3️⃣ converts visitors into wait‑list subscribers.
Primary Audience: K‑12 & higher‑ed teachers, school administrators, ed‑tech investors, and engaged parents.

2.2 Problem → Solution Split (two‑column)
Problem (left)	Papyr Solution (right)
• Teachers don’t have the bandwidth or tools to close every learning gap.
• Students often fall behind quietly until midterms.
• Existing LMS add‑ons don’t personalize at scale.	• Papyr spotlights each student’s learning gaps using existing LMS data.
• AI autogrades assignments and adapts practice instantly.
• Real‑time dashboards reveal class‑wide pain points.
• Students can chat with a 24 / 7 AI tutor that “knows” their coursework, grades, and stumbling blocks—like having the teacher beside them at any hour.

2.3 Feature Cards (icon + headline + 25‑word blurb each)
Adaptive Practice Generator — creates personalized quizzes and homework in one click.

Real‑Time Error Insights — flags misconceptions the moment they appear.

24 / 7 AI Tutor — chat‑based help that draws on each student’s assignments, grades, and class timeline.
